NPV
Net Present Value(NPV) is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of 
cash outflows.NPV is used in capital budgeting to analyze the profitability of a projected investment 
or project
NPV=¦²£¨CI-CO£©£¨1+i£©^(-t)
where 
Ct = net cash inflow during thr period t 
Co = total initial investment costs
r = discount rate 
t= number of time periods
In our project, the cost of capital represents the value of discount rate and the annual net benefit of 
three years will be taken into the calculation of NPV 
Net Present Value = 500(1+10%)+514(1+10%)^2+560(1+10%)^3-952=287.75

IRR 
Internal rate of return(IRR) is a matric used in captial budgeting measuring the profitablity of protential
investement. Internal rate of return is a discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows 
from a particular project equal to zero 
base on the NPV calculation of the case above,the value of discount rate could be get when NPV = 0

500/(1+r)+514/(1+r)^2+560/(1+r)^3-952 = 0 
IRR = 29%.



NPV= 112(1+10%)+600.40(1+10%)^2+1201.74(1+10%)^3-420 =   
IRR= 112/(1+r)+600.40/(1+r)^2+1201.74/(1+r)^3-420=0  r =
