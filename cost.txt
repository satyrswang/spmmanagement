PS: The cost of hardwares including iPads, pc and other peripherals for communication while delivering is calculated under the following standard: 3000 (RMB/iPad) *8 (iPad) + 8000 (RMB/PC) *30 (PC)+5000£¨RMB/server£©*6£¨servers£© = 294,000 RMB.Other aspects such as place rent(per year) and office materials and installation\test cost us about 130,000RMB.So we have to spend about 420,000RMB on the hardware part.

Also,the software,API renting,IDE,license,network cost and data update will cost totally about 12,000RMB.

When it comes to staff expenses,we plan to spend about 1500RMB/per person for staff training and team building.
